# Black-Box

A community-driven, modular, code sharing utility.

Black Box is a text editor plug-in designed to enable people to share and see other programmer's code snippets. The objective is to promote the creation of context independent functions and algorithms and spread reusable code. Essentially a user will be able to search for a specific function/algorithm and sort through a list of rated implementations by other users.
